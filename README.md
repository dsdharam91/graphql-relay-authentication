# graphql-relay-authentication
This project is a simple application to use as a starting point for an authentication based React/Relay application.

This application has the following characteristics:

- front end built with react and relay
- back end will be a GraphQL server with no actual persistent layer (everything in memory)
- application will have a login and register pages
- a protected page which will be available only to authenticated user

[fortruce/relay-skeleton](https://github.com/fortruce/relay-skeleton): skeleton for a React, Relay, GraphQL project. I expect
to change the structure of the project over time but this skeleton is a very valuable starting point. 

[Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/): very intersting initiative by [Olivier Lacan](http://olivierlacan.com/) to formalize 
the way you should write your CHANGELOG.md file. Worth giving it a try.
